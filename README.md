# my-article-app: Article and Author Management System (Go, Fiber, GORM)

`my-article-app` is an integrated web application built with Go that provides a RESTful API for managing articles and authors. The application is built using the Fiber framework and the GORM library for interacting with PostgreSQL, following a clean and scalable architecture.

  - Read all articles or a specific article (including author data).
  - Update article data.
  - Delete articles.
- **Comprehensive Author Management:**
  - Create new authors.
  - Read all authors or a specific author (including their list of articles).
  - Update author data.
  - Delete authors (considering associated articles).
- **Strong Data Relationships:**
  - One-to-many relationship between authors and articles.
  - Preloading of related data for improved performance.
- **Data Validation:**
  - Use of the `go-playground/validator` library to ensure the integrity of input data.
- **Clean Application Architecture:**
  - Handlers, Use Cases, Repositories, Models.
- **Easy Setup and Operation:**
  - Use of Docker and Docker Compose to easily run a PostgreSQL database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Go (Golang) 1.18+

## üèõÔ∏è Project Structure


 * my-article-app/ (Root directory of your project)
   * main.go (Main application entry point)
   * article.go (Article model and related logic - e.g., handlers, repository)
   * author.go (Author model and related logic)
   * database.go (Database connection and setup)
   * go.mod (Manages project dependencies)
   * go.sum (Checksums of dependencies)
   * README.md (Project description and setup instructions)
   * docker-compose.yml (Optional: for Docker setup)



**Request Flow:**
1. An HTTP request arrives at the Fiber server.
2. Fiber routes the request to the appropriate Handler.
3. The Handler parses the request and validates the input.
4. The Handler calls the appropriate UseCase.
5. The UseCase coordinates operations with the Repository.
6. The Repository executes database operations using GORM.
7. Results are returned through the layers to the Handler, which sends the response to the client.

## üöÄ Prerequisites and Setup

### Prerequisites:
- **Go:** Version 1.18 or later
- **Docker and Docker Compose:** To run the PostgreSQL database (optional)
- **Git:** To clone the repository

### Setup Steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-link>
    cd my-article-app
    ```
2.  **Set up the database (using Docker Compose):**
    - A pre-configured `docker-compose.yml` file is provided:
    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'
    services:
      postgres_db:
        image: postgres:13-alpine
        container_name: my_article_app_db
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
          POSTGRES_DB: article_db
        ports:
          - "5432:5432"
        volumes:
          - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    volumes:
      postgres_data:
    ```
    - To run the database:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    - **Note:** Ensure that the connection settings in `internal/database/gorm.go` (the `dsn` variable) match your Docker or local PostgreSQL settings.

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    go run ./cmd/api/main.go
    ```
    A message will appear indicating that the server is running on port `3000`.
